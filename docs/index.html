      A proposal to limit Presidential Pardon powers and enforce accountability.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The Article II pardon power of the President is considered plenary. In other words, the pardon power 
        is absolute, unqualified, and not reviewable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the pardon power is.</h2>
      <p>
      "The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, 
       except in Cases of impeachment."
      </p>
      <p>
        - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer"></a>Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Necessity</h2>
      <p>
      This results in a perverse system where the President could pardon those who commit crimes on his or her orders. 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">Trump v. US</a>, 603 U.S. 593 (2023), has given the President virtually unlimited immunity, there can be situations where crimes 
      committed by the Executive Branch can go unpunished, or even unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        This undermines the rule of law. It erodes respect for the law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What does this amendment not do:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It does not abolish the ability of the President to issue pardons.</li>
        <li>It does not keep a President from righting a wrong.</li>
        <li>It does not allow courts to ajudicate legitimate pardons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The amenement makes explicit what has heretofore been considered an abuse of the pardon power. Recent 
        history has taught us that the power to pardon can be used to escape responsibility for criminal wrongdoing. 
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Proposed Amendment</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Section 1.</strong> The pardon power of the President shall not extend to any person who, 
          at the time of the conduct for which pardon is sought:
        <p>(a) held an office of the United States whose appointment required confirmation by the Senate;</p>
        <p>(b) served in an acting, interim, or temporary capacity in any such office; or</p>
        <p>(c) served in the Executive Office of the President or in any successor office designated by Congress, 
          regardless of title or organizational form.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 2.</strong>Every pardon shall:</p>
        <p>(a) identify the individual by legal name;</p>
        <p>(b) specify the conduct pardoned; and</p>
        <p>(c) identify the federal statute or statues, including section numbers, to which the pardon applies; and</p>
        <p>(d) shall apply only to the offenses expressly identified and to no other offense, whether related or arising 
          from the same conduct.</p>
        <p>No pardon may use general, omnibus, or open-ended language such as, but not limited to, 
          &ldquo;all offenses against the United States.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>Section 3.</strong>
        <p>No President may pardon himself or herself. No pardon may be issued to any class of persons defined by office, 
          agency, function, or status.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 4.</strong> Any pardon issued in violation of this Amendment shall have no legal force.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 5.</strong>Nothing in this Amendment shall restrict the President&rsquo;s power to grant pardons 
          to persons not described in Section 1, except as limited by the requirements of Section 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 6.</strong>This Amendment shall take effect upon ratification.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
      This site exists to articulate a clear constitutional argument: that a plenary pardon power is incompatible 
      with modern federal law and democratic accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is non-partisan, informational, and intended for public discussion. All text is offered for
        reuse, citation, and critique.
